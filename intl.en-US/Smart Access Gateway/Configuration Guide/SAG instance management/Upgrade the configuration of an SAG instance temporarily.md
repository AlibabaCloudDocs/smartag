# Upgrade the configuration of an SAG instance temporarily {#task_1013202 .task}

This topic describes how to temporarily upgrade the configuration of a Subscription Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) instance.

A temporary configuration upgrade can be applied to increase the bandwidth of an SAG to handle the traffic generated during public holidays or sales promotions. After the temporary configuration upgrade expires, the instance automatically restores the previous bandwidth and specifications.

-   The minimum duration of a temporary configuration upgrade is two hours. The temporary configuration upgrade is billed by the hour. The upgraded bandwidth takes effect as soon as the payment is completed. Temporary configuration upgrades do not interrupt current services.
-   When the restoration time specified for the SAG instance arrives, the instance automatically restores the previous bandwidth.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Smart Access Gateway**. On the displayed page, find the target instance, and then click the drop-down list arrow in the **Network Type** column.![Drop-down list arrow](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/817218/156571157350982_en-US.png)
