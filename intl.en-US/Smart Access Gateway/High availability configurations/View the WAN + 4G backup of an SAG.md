# View the WAN + 4G backup of an SAG {#task_1062462 .task}

This topic describes how to view the WAN + 4G backup of a Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\). By default, WAN + 4G backup is enabled for SAG-100WM and SAG-1000 to use wired broadband as the active link and wireless 4G-LTE as the standby link. If the active link fails, the system automatically switches to the standby link.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, clickSmart Access Gateway, and then click the instance ID of the SAG for which you want to perform an active/standby switchover.
3.  In the left-side navigation pane of the SAG details page, click **HA Configuration**.
4.  On the HA Configuration page, view the current active and standby links of the SAG in the **WAN + 4G** area. The HA structure of SAG-100WM and SAG-1000 is displayed, as shown in the following figure.
