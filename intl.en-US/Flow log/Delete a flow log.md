# Delete a flow log {#task_1846314 .task}

This topic describes how to delete a flow log. You can delete a flow log that is in the **Started** or **Inactive** state. After you delete a flow log, you can view the traffic data that was captured in the Log Service console or the NetFlow server.

If the flow log to be deleted is associated with one or more Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) instances, disassociate the SAG instances first. For more information, see [Disassociate an SAG instance](intl.en-US/Flow log/Disassociate an SAG instance.md#).

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Flow Log**.
3.  On the Flow Log page, find the target flow log and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.
