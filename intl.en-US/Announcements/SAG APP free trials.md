# SAG APP free trials

Alibaba Cloud is offering free trials of Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) APP.

## Applicants

Only first-time users who have Alibaba Cloud accounts are eligible for the free trials. The accounts of the users must have passed real-name verification.

**Note:**

-   First-time users are defined as users who are purchasing SAG APP for the first time. That is, their accounts do not have any pre-existing purchase or operation record. If a user has multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, and one of the accounts has a purchase record, the user is not considered a first-time user.
-   Each user is limited to one free trial. If a user has multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, the user can choose only one account for the free trial. Alibaba Cloud determines whether different Alibaba Cloud accounts belong to the same user based on the associated information when these accounts are created, logged on, and used. The associated information includes the identity number, phone number, payment account, device, and address shared by these accounts.

## Duration

The free trial promotion begins on April 1, 2021 and ends on April 1, 2022. Each applicant can apply for a free trial of one year.

## How to participate

If you meet the preceding requirements, you can log on to the [SAG console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com/software/cn-shanghai/softwares) and claim a free client account.

## Promotion scope

After you claim a free client account, you are provided with a free SAG APP instance. The following table list the specification of the instance.

|Service|Instance specification and data transfer plan|
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
|SAG APP|One client account, 5 GB of free data usage for each account per month, and a maximum bandwidth of 2 Mbit/s.|

Promotion notes:

-   The free trial starts when the SAG service is activated under the account.
-   During the free trial period, each client account has 5 GB of free data usage in each month. The amount of data usage that exceeds the data transfer plan is charged based on the pay-as-you-go billing method. For more information, see [Billing and pricing of the SAG app](/intl.en-US/Smart Access Gateway APP/Billing and pricing of the SAG app.md).
-   After the free trial ends, the SAG APP instance is automatically released if you do not renew it. If you want to continue using the SAG APP instance, you can renew it. For more information, see [Renew an instance](/intl.en-US/Smart Access Gateway APP/User guide for administrators/Renew an instance.md).

## Promotion terms

If you violate any of the following terms, the free trial will become invalid. Alibaba Cloud reserves the right to adjust and terminate the promotion at any time.

-   You shall not transfer services under free trial to other users.
-   You shall not use services under free trial to engage in illegal activities. Otherwise, you shall bear all the consequences arising therefrom.
-   You shall not use the free trial services to manage illegal businesses on the Internet. Alibaba Cloud reserves the right to shut down your businesses and shall not assume any responsibility arising therefrom.
