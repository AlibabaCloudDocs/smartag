# Announcement of the SAG app for iOS

Valued users of the SAG app for iOS:

Due to changes in the official release of iOS 14, your SAG app may encounter errors after you upgrade the iOS 14 beta version to the official release. To ensure stable connections to Alibaba Cloud, we recommend that you do not upgrade to the official release of iOS 14.

If you have already upgraded to the official release of iOS 14,[submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.15120809.nav-right.dticket.130266ebEB92in#/ticket/add/?productId=1308) to request solutions. Alibaba Cloud is in contact with Apple to fix this issue.
