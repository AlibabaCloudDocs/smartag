# Benefits {#concept_ygt_zyd_lfb .concept}

Smart Access Gateway is highly intelligent, secure, and reliable, and a unified management platform is provided for you to manage the gateway device.

## Intelligent {#section_ijh_zzd_lfb .section}

With highly automatic configurations and zero touch provisioning \(ZTO\), Smart Access Gateway automatically adapts the network topology changes.

## Reliable {#section_ukd_d12_lfb .section}

Nearby access within a city through the Internet is implemented. Additionally, multiple local branches can access the Alibaba Cloud through the device-level or link-level active/standby mode.

-   Device-level disaster recovery

    Dual-device active/standby mode is implemented so that the traffic is immediately distributed to the standby device when the active device fails.

-   Link-level disaster recovery

    Each gateway device implements dual-link sealed access. The optimal link is automatically detected and assigned to be the active link. Traffic is distributed to the standby link when the active link fails.


## Secure {#section_ayt_d12_lfb .section}

The local branches and the Alibaba Cloud are connected through an encrypted private network and the transmission over the Internet is also encrypted.

-   Data encryption

    Both IKE and IPsec protocols are used to encrypt the transmitted data to guarantee data security.

-   Anti-replay

    The data source is authenticated to prevent replay attacks.

-   Anti-tampering

    The data is authenticated through multiple ways.


## Centralized management {#section_e2v_212_lfb .section}

The Alibaba Cloud console provides a central platform for managing and configuring Smart Access Gateway.
