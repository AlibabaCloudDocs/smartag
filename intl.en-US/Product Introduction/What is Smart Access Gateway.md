# What is Smart Access Gateway {#concept_i2w_zgs_j2b .concept}

Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) is a one-stop solution for connecting local branches to the Alibaba Cloud. With Smart Access Gateway, enterprises can access Alibaba Cloud through the Internet in an encrypted way, and get a more intelligent, more reliable, and more secure experience in accessing the Alibaba Cloud.

## Components {#section_fdf_cls_j2b .section}

-   Smart Access Gateway instance

    A Smart Access Gateway instance is the logic mapping of a Smart Access Gateway device. You can manage the instance on the console to operate the device.

-   Smart Access Gateway device

    Smart Access Gateway is a hardware gateway device used by local branches to access Alibaba Cloud. You can purchase a gateway device by creating a Smart Access Gateway instance on the Alibaba Cloud console and Alibaba Cloud delivers the device to you according to the address you provided. Additionally, you can manage and view the delivery status on the console. For more information, see [Device introduction](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Device introduction.md#).

-   Cloud Connect Network

    Cloud Connect Network \(CCN\) is another important component of the Smart Access Gateway. It is a device access matrix composed of Alibaba Cloud distributed Smart Access Gateways.

    You can add multiple Smart Access Gateway devices to a CCN instance and then attach the CCN instance to a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance to connect the local branches to the Alibaba Cloud.

    The area of the CCN instance and the Smart Access Gateway instances to add must be the same. A local branch can access the Alibaba Cloud without any other configurations if the CCN areas and CEN areas are the same. For more information, see [Cloud Connect Network](../../../../../intl.en-US//Cloud Connect Network.md#).


## Scenarios {#section_vxm_pwg_4fb .section}

Smart Access Gateway connects organizations \(such as local data centers, branches, and outlets\) to Alibaba Cloud, allowing you to quickly establish a hybrid cloud.
