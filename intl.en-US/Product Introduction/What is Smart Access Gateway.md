# What is Smart Access Gateway {#concept_i2w_zgs_j2b .concept}

Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) is an all-in-one solution for connecting local branches to the Alibaba Cloud. With Smart Access Gateway, enterprises can access Alibaba Cloud through the Internet using a fully encrypted connection, which offers greater benefits including a more intelligent, more reliable, and more secure network experience.

## Components {#section_fdf_cls_j2b .section}

-   Smart Access Gateway instance

    A Smart Access Gateway instance is the logic mapping of a Smart Access Gateway device. You can operate the device by managing the instance on the console.

-   Smart Access Gateway device

    Smart Access Gateway provides gateway devices that are used by local branches to access. You can purchase a gateway device by creating a Smart Access Gateway instance on the Alibaba Cloud console and Alibaba Cloud delivers the device to you according to the address you provided. Additionally, you can view the delivery status on the console to configure and manage the device. For more information, see [Device introduction](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Smart Access Gateway device/Device introduction.md#).

-   Cloud Connect Network

    Cloud Connect Network \(CCN\) is another important component of the Smart Access Gateway. It is a device access matrix composed of Alibaba Cloud distributed Smart Access Gateways.

    You can add multiple Smart Access Gateway devices to a CCN instance and then attach the CCN instance to a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance to connect the local branches to the Alibaba Cloud.

    The CCN instance and the Smart Access Gateway instances to be added must be in the same area. If the CCN areas and CEN areas are the same, the local branch can directly access Alibaba Cloud without additional configurations required. For more information, see [Cloud Connect Network](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/CCN/Cloud Connect Network.md#).


## Scenarios {#section_vxm_pwg_4fb .section}

Smart Access Gateway connects organizations \(such as local data centers, branches, and outlets\) to Alibaba Cloud, allowing you to implement highly scalable services and easily establish a hybrid cloud.
