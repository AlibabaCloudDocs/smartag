# What is Smart Access Gatewayï¼Ÿ {#concept_i2w_zgs_j2b .concept}

Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) is an all-in-one solution for connecting local branches to Alibaba Cloud. With Smart Access Gateway, enterprises can access Alibaba Cloud through the Internet using a fully encrypted connection, allowing businesses to experience a more intelligent, more reliable, and more secure network. Smart Access Gateway includes Smart Access Gateway Hardware and Smart Access Gateway Software. Smart Access Gateway Hardware is a physical device used for site-to-site connection by using a leased line, a broadband link, or a 4G link. Smart Access Gateway Software is used for point-to-site connection.

## Components {#section_fdf_cls_j2b .section}

-   Smart Access Gateway instance

    A Smart Access Gateway instance is the logic mapping of a Smart Access Gateway Hardware device or a Smart Access Gateway Software client. You can operate the device or the software client by managing the instance in the console.

-   Smart Access Gateway device

    Smart Access Gateway provides gateway devices that are used by local branches to access Alibaba Cloud. You can purchase a gateway device by creating a Smart Access Gateway instance on the Alibaba Cloud console. After you complete the payment, Alibaba Cloud sends the device to you. You can view the delivery status of the device, and then configure and manage the device through the console. For more information, see [Device introduction](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Smart Access Gateway Hardware device/Device introduction.md#).

    **Note:** Only Smart Access Gateway Hardware corresponds to a device.

-   Alibaba Cloud network client

    End users of Smart Access Gateway Software can achieve mobile access to an intranet through an Alibaba Cloud network client.

-   Cloud Connect Network

    Cloud Connect Network \(CCN\) is a device access matrix composed of Alibaba Cloud distributed Smart Access Gateways.

    You can add multiple Smart Access Gateway devices to a CCN instance and then attach the CCN instance to a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance to connect the local branches to the Alibaba Cloud.

    The CCN instance and the Smart Access Gateway instances to be added must be in the same area. If the CCN areas and CEN areas are the same, the local branch can directly access Alibaba Cloud without additional configurations required. For more information, see [Cloud Connect Network](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/CCN/Cloud Connect Network.md#).

-   Express Cloud Connect

    Express Cloud Connect is a service for connecting to the cloud that features high reliability, high performance, high speed and low latency. It is based on the hardware capabilities of Smart Access Gateway and built-in routing encapsulation technology, and is integrated with one or more physical connections provided by carriers. For more information, see [Activate Express Cloud Connect](../../../../intl.en-US/Physical Connection/Express Cloud Connect (Beta)/Activate Express Cloud Connect.md#).


## Scenarios of Smart Access Gateway Hardware {#section_vxm_pwg_4fb .section}
