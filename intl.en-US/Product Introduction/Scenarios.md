Smart Access Gateway connects organizations \(such as local data centers, branches, and outlets\) to Alibaba Cloud, allowing you to quickly establish a hybrid cloud.

-   Scenario

    Through a hub-spoken or P2P network, branches of an international company across the world can access the company's VPCs in Alibaba Cloud.

-   Architecture

    You can purchase Smart Access Gateway devices for branches and the headquarters. You can then attach the devices to a CCN instance to connect the devices with one another, and attach the CCN instance to a CEN instance. After they are attached, the local branches can access any VPC attached to the CEN instance.

    For more information, see [Connect to Alibaba Cloud in the same area](../../../../intl.en-US/Tutorial/Connect local branches to VPCs.md#).

-   Applications

    This architecture is applicable to industries that use a self-built local data center and a VPC to provide external services, as typically seen in the manufacturing industry. You can use Smart Access Gateway devices to build a hybrid cloud and expand the on-premises network.
