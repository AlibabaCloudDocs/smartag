# Delete an SAG instance

This topic describes how to delete a Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) instance that is locked due to overdue payments.

Before you start, make sure that the following requirements are met:

-   The SAG instance to be deleted is locked due to overdue payments. For more information about the states of an SAG instance, see [Monitor the status of an SAG device]().
-   The SAG instance to be deleted is not associated with any Cloud Connect Network \(CCN\) instance or virtual border router \(VBR\). If the SAG instance is associated with a CCN instance or VBR, dissociate the SAG instance before you delete it. For more information, see [Detach a network](/intl.en-US/Configuration Guide/Configure networks in the cloud/Detach a network.md).

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).
