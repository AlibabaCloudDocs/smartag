    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Region|The region where the Alibaba Cloud network client is used. If the client is to be used in another region, we recommend that you purchase a client in that region. This is because a client will be connected to the network of the region where it is purchased.

 |
    |Number of client accounts|The number of client accounts that the administrator can create. Generally, one account is created for each employee that needs to log on to the client. **Note:** Currently, an administrator can purchase 5 to 1000 accounts for each client. Tiered pricing is applied based on the number of client accounts required. For more information, see [Billing of Smart Access Gateway APP](reseller.en-US/Smart Access Gateway APP/Billing of Smart Access Gateway APP.md#).
