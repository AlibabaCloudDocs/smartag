If you are an end user, you must contact the administrator to reset the password.

If you are the administrator, you can reset the password by following these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com/sag/cn-shanghai/sags).
2.  Click the instance ID of the target Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) APP. In the Client Accounts area of the Smart Access Gateway APP Details page, find the account for which the password is to be reset.
3.  Click **Reset Password** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Confirm Password Resetting dialog box, click **OK**.

    The system sends the new password to the specified email address of the corresponding account.
