# Step 2: Set the password when you log on for the first time {#task_ymn_441_qfb .task}

When you log on to the Web console for the first time after powering on the Smart Access Gateway, you must set the logon password of the Web console.

Before logging on to the Web configuration page, make sure that:

-   The Smart Access Gateway is started.
-   The local client is already configured with a static IP. For more information, see [Step 1: Configure the local client](intl.en-US/SAG-1000 Configuration Guide/Web configuration/Step 1: Configure the local client.md#).
-   The local PC is connected to Port 2 of the Smart Access Gateway through a network cable.

1.  Enter `192.168.0.1` in your browser. 

    `192.168.0.1` is the default Web configuration address of the gateway device.

2.  Enter a logon password. 

    We recommend that you securely store your logon password and keep it strictly confidential. If the password is lost or forgotten, press the reset button to clear the password. Then, log on to the Web console to set a new password.

    **Note:** If you press the reset button at least three times within 10 seconds, all configurations will be cleared.

3.  Log on to the Web configuration page.
