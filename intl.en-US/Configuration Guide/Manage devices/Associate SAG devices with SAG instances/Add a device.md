# Add a device

This topic describes how to add a Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) device in the SAG console to associate the device with the SAG instance. You can manage SAG devices in the SAG console.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).

2.  Use one of the following methods to open the Device Management tab.

    -   Click the ID of the SAG instance. On the instance details page, click **Device Management**.
    -   Find the SAG instance and choose **![The Hide/Show icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4492404061/p101595.png)** \> **Device Management** in the **Actions** column.
    **Note:** If the SAG instance is not associated with any SAG device, after you open the Device Management tab, a message appears requiring you to add a device.

3.  On the Device Management tab, enter the serial number of the active device.

5.  After you add the device, click **Add Standby Device** on the Device Management tab to add a standby device.

    **Note:**

    -   You can add a standby device only after you add the active device.
