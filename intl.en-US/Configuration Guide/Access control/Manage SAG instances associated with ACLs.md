# Manage SAG instances associated with ACLs

This topic describes how to associate Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) instances with or disassociate SAG instances from access control lists \(ACLs\).

## Associate SAG instances with an ACL

After you create an ACL, you must associate it with SAG instances so that the ACL can be applied to the SAG instances. After you associate an ACL with an SAG instance, the SAG instance can use the ACL to control network traffic that goes through the SAG instance.

1.  Log on to the [SAG console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the ACL is created.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **ACL**.

4.  On the **ACL** page, find the ACL that you want to manage and click **Add Instances** in the **Actions** column.

5.  On the **Associated Instances** tab, click **Associate with Instance**.

6.  In the **Associate with Instance** dialog box, select one or more SAG instances.

7.  Click **OK**.


## Disassociate instances from an ACL

4.  On the **ACL** page, find and click the ID of the ACL that you want to manage.

5.  On the ACL instance details page, click the **Associated Instances** tab.
