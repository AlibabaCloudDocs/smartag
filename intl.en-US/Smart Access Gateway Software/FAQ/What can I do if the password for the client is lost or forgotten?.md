If you are an end user, you must contact the administrator to reset the password.

If you are the administrator, you can reset the password by following these steps:

1.  Log on to the [SAG console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com/sag/cn-shanghai/sags).
2.  Click the instance ID of the target software. In the Client Account Management area of the Smart Access Gateway Software Details page, find the account for which the password is to be reset.
3.  Click **Reset Password** in the **Actions** column.
4.  On the Reset Password Confirmation page, click **OK**.

    The system then sends the new password to the specified email address of the corresponding account.
