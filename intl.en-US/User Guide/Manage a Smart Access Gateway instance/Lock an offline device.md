When the gateway device is offline, you can lock the gateway device and then the device cannot be used any more.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.  On the SAG page, click the ID of the target gateway instance. 
3.  On the Instance Details page, turn the **Offline Lock** button to **Enable**.

4.  Enter a threshold \(in seconds\) for the locked status to take effect and click **OK**. 

    For example, if 3600 is entered, the gateway device becomes locked after 60 minutes.

    When you need to enable the gateway device, turn the **Offline Lock** button to **Disable**. Then, you can use the gateway device as normal.
