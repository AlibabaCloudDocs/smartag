# Activate the gateway device {#task_hbw_y3b_mfb .task}

After receiving the gateway device, you must activate it in the console. You can only use the Smart Access Gateway device after activating it.

Billing starts right after the device is activated. For more information, see [Billing](../../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing.md#).

**Note:** If the device is not manually activated, by default the system automatically activates the gateway device and billing starts 15 days after the device is received.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.  On the SAG page, find the target gateway instance. 
3.  Click **Activate** in the **Actions** column.
