# Device-level configurations for high availability {#task_y24_gj3_4fb .task}

By default, active/standby links are enabled on the SAG-100WM device. The broadband link operates as the active link and the wireless 4G-LTE operates as the standby link. If the active link fails, traffic is automatically distributed to the standby link.

**Note:** Currently, active/standby links are only supported by SAG-100WM devices.
