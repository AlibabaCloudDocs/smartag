# Introduction to Smart Access Gateway instances {#concept_bdb_5wn_qfb .concept}

A Smart Access Gateway instance is the logical mapping of a Smart Access Gateway device. You can manage the gateway instance in the console, which is equivalent to operating the gateway device.

After you buy a Smart Access Gateway device on the console, you can view the condition of the gateway device through the instance status. A gateway device can be in any of the following statuses:

|Instance status|Instructions|
|:--------------|:-----------|
|Ordered|The gateway device has been ordered but has not been shipped.|
|Shipped|The gateway device has been shipped and is awaiting confirmation of receipt.|
|Ready|The gateway device is in a normal state and can be used.|
|Not bound|The gateway device is not associated to a CCN instance.|
|Offline|The gateway device is not connected to the controller.|
|Locked|The device has overdue payments associated with it.|

After establishing the network architecture, you can view the network topology on the details page of the instance, as shown in the following figure.
