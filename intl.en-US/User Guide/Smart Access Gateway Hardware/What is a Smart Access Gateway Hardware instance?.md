# What is a Smart Access Gateway Hardware instance? {#concept_bdb_5wn_qfb .concept}

A Smart Access Gateway instance is the logical mapping of a Smart Access Gateway Hardware \(the physical gateway device\). You can manage the gateway instance in the console, which is equivalent to operating the Smart Access Gateway device.

After you buy an SAG device on the console, you can view the condition of the SAG device through the instance status. An SAG device can be in any of the following statuses:

|Instance status|Instructions|
|:--------------|:-----------|
|Ordered|The SAG device has been ordered but has not been shipped.|
|Shipped|The SAG device has been shipped and is awaiting confirmation of receipt.|
|Ready|The SAG device is in a normal state and can be used.|
|Not bound|The SAG device is not associated to a CCN instance.|
|Offline|The SAG device is not connected to the controller.|
|Locked|The SAG has overdue payments associated with it.|

After establishing the network architecture, you can view the network topology on the details page of the instance, as shown in the following figure.
