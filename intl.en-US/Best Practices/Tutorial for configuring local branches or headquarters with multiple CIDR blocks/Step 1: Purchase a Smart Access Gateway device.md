After you buy a Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) device in the console, Alibaba Cloud delivers the device to you and creates an SAG instance for you to manage.

1.  Log on to the [Smart Access Gateway console](https://smartag.console.aliyun.com). 
2.  On the SAG page, click **Create SmartAG**. 
3.  Configure the SAG device and click **Buy Now**. 

    For more information, see [Gateway device configurations](../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Catalogue/Buy a Smart Access Gateway.md#).

    **Note:** In this tutorial, the **SAG-100WM** specification and the **Stand-alone** usage method are selected.

4.  Confirm the order information, and then click **Pay**. 
5.  On the Address dialog box, enter the shipping address of the gateway device and click **Order Now**. You can check whether the order is successfully placed on the status page of the Smart Access Gateway instance. The system will deliver the device within two days after the order is placed. If you do not receive the device within two days, you can open a ticket to check the delivery status.
