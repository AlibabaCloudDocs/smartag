# Cross-region access to VPC {#concept_hxx_njz_k2b .concept}

This tutorial uses a Beijing branch as an example to describe how to connect local branches to VPCs in Hangzhou and US \(Silicon Valley\) through a Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\). After you connect local branches to VPCs, clients of the local branches can directly access the VPCs through the SAG.

## Scenario {#section_xc3_bkz_k2b .section}

For access of local branches in Mainland China, you only need to attach the CCN associated with the SAG device to the CEN in the same area and configure the region connection between the Hangzhou VPC and the US \(Silicon Valley\) VPC.
