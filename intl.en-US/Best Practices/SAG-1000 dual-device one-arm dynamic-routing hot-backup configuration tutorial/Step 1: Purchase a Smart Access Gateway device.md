    **Note:** In this tutorial, the **SAG-1000** specification and the **Standby** usage method are selected.

4.  Confirm the order information, and then click **Pay**. 
5.  On the Address dialog box, enter the shipping address of the gateway device and click **Order Now**. You can check whether the order is successfully placed on the status page of the Smart Access Gateway instance. The system will deliver the device within two days after the order is placed.
